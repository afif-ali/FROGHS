                <h2>MORE ABOUT FROGHS</h2>
                <p>Froghs are all over the wornold planning a domitation scheme, they seem powerless... but only few have discovered their true powers. It is predicted that froghs will dominate the entire galaxy during the next 100 years.<br>Froghs also love to eat human flesh, as it's what allows them to morph into rarer froghs and thus become even more powerful. This ability to morph, or as some call it: "level up", is the reason why humans still don't know everything about froghs</p>
